## Ratbot will try to determine its version number on startup for some informational commands.
## It will do so by trying the following, in order:
## - Read the version_string setting
## - Read the first line of version_file
## - Execute version_cmd and read the first line of its stdout.  This is interpreted using the shell.
## - Execute git describe --tags --long --always from one of its source directories.  The path to git can be changed
##   with 'version_git'
## The default behavior is usually fine, but uncomment one of these if you wish to change it
